# Overview of the analysis

The purpose of this analysis was to collect and examine data from the local city bike service in New York City, to be able to pitch to investors that a bike-sharing service would be a profitable business in Des Moines. Using Pandas, we were able to convert the raw data into more readable format. Additionally, we applied the use of Tableau, which transformed the citibike data into graphic visualizations which displayed the trends and relationships between customers and the usage of the citbikes.

# Results


Checkout Times for Users

In the above visualization, it is apparent that the peak for the length of time citibikes were checked out was around 5-6 minutes. After roughly hitting the five minute mark, the graph begins to decline for any longer trips. A conclusion we can draw from this, is that New Yorkers may opt to use a citibike to get to their destination if it is a short distance away. This could be wanting to bike instead of walking to their destination during the hot summer months or using the citibikes as their main mode of transportation as many people in busy cities do not own a vehicle. 

Checkout Times by Gender

Like the previous visualization, this graph shows the peak length of time citibikes are being used. It is evident that males are the top customers of citibikes in comparison to females and unknown. The length of time they are normally checking out the bikes for also peaks at roughly ten minutes.


Ride Start times by Weekday

This heat map displays when the citibikes are being used throughout the days of the week. The concentration of bikes being used falls within Monday – Friday, before 9:00AM and after 5:00PM. We can predict that the users during these times, are using citibikes are their mode of transportation to and from work or school. 


Ride Start times by Gender

A similar heat map was created to portray the trips made during the weekdays, based on gender. The concentration of citibikes used, seems to be by males primarily in the hours mentioned for the previous heat map.


User Trips by Gender by Weekday


This graphic divides the citibike data by customers or subscribers of the service. Throughout the days of the week, it is shown that customers that use citibikes are generally females, followed by males, and then unknown. Whereas, subscribers of the services are heavily males, followed by the unknown category, and then females.


# Summary

Overall, the mass number of citibike users seem to be males travelling on weekdays in the earlier hours of the morning, and during rush hour traffic after 5:00PM. Citibike users also fall under the category of being subscribers rather than being customers. Further visualizations I would suggest for this citibike data would be to collect and sort data on citibike users who are tourists to New York City, or simply from other boroughs or cities and track their usage of the bikes. Another supportive visualization which could be made is to track the area of New York in which the citibikes are being utilized the most. This can help in deciphering where there needs to be an increased supply of citibikes. Altogether, these additional visualizations alongside the graphics we have created for New York citibikes, should aid in the decision of taking the citibike venture to Des Moines.
