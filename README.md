# Overview of the analysis

The purpose of this analysis was to collect and examine data from the local city bike service in New York City, in order to be able to pitch to investors that a bike-sharing service would be a profitable business in Des Moines. Using Pandas, we were able to convert the raw data into more readable format. Additionally, we applied the use of Tableau, which transformed the citi-bike data into graphic visualizations which displayed the trends and relationships between customers and the usage of the city-bikes.
