# Overview of the analysis

The purpose of this analysis was to collect and examine data from the local city bike service in New York City, in order to be able to pitch to investors that a bike-sharing service would be a profitable business in Des Moines. Using Pandas, we were able to convert the raw data into more readable format. Additionally, we applied the use of Tableau, which transformed the citi-bike data into graphic visualizations which displayed the trends and relationships between customers and the usage of the city-bikes.

# Results


Checkout Times for Users

In the above visualization, it is apparent that the peak for the length of time citibikes were checked out was around 5-6 minutes. After roughly hitting the five minute mark, the graph begins to decline for any longer trips. A conclusion we can draw from this, is that New Yorkers may opt to use a citibike to get to their destination if it is a short distance away. This could be wanting to bike instead of walking to their destination during the hot summer months or using the citibikes as their main mode of transportation as many people in busy cities do not own a vehicle. 

Checkout Times by Gender


Ride Start times by Weekday

This heat map displays when the citibikes are being used throughout the days of the week. The concentration of bikes being used falls within Monday – Friday, before 9:00AM and after 5:00PM. We can predict that the users during these times, are using citibikes are their mode of transportation to and from work or school. 


Ride Start times by Gender

A similar heat map was created to portray the trips made during the weekdays, based on gender. The concentration of citibikes used, seems to be by males primarily in the hours mentioned for the previous heat map.

Two further visualizations I would suggest for this citibike data would be as follows:
